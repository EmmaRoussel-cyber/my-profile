	<h2> Travelling</h2> 
         <p> I used to live 3 years in Mexio, 2 years in South Korea and finally I have done my exchange semester in Georgia at Tbilisi. All those experiences have gave me the passion of travelling: Road trip in Thailand, Armenia, Vietnam, Tokyo, St Petersburg ... Actually I don't have any money to travel but hope I will fly soon ...

	<h2> Eating </h2>
	     <p>
		 Passion number 2: eating. Actually, I think that I love travelling because of the opportunity to discover new meals. Moreover, you can eat whatever you want even if it gets you fater as you can't regret it: indeed, you won't have the opportunity to taste this everyday later !!!

 	     <h2>Listening, support and advising </h2>
             <p> I won't say that it is a passion but it is a big part of my personality and my person as a whole. It is very important for me to be present for people in need, give support, being cheerful, advise them in their personal life.
